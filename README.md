# music.roygdavis.dev

A React music visualiser using some of the visualiser examples provided in the Mozilla MDN docs.
But the real star of the show is the [butterchurn](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn) library offering Milkdrop visuals just like WinAmp offers.

To see the app in action right now, visit [music.roygdavis.dev](https://music.roygdavis.dev) and drag&drop your music file onto the page (doesn't work on mobile - yet).
